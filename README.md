# Food Quiz

### Individual project for the Bon Appétit Cooking Club (Spring 2015)

##### Description:
The goal of this project was to facilitate the organization of a Food Trivia Quiz event that was held by the Bon Appétit Cooking Club at the American University in Bulgaria, which I was a member of. The original intention for the quiz was to have a PowerPoint presentation with the questions and to use a timer for measuring the 30 seconds allotted to answering each question. However, I thought that this process was inefficient, so I decided to create this program the day before the event.
